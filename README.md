### Clicky Crab

### Overview

The user must click on each image only once. The score increases with each correct click.  If the user clicks the same image more than once, a game over message will be displayed and the game will reset.  If the user successfully clicks all the images, a congratulations message will be displayed and the game will reset.  This app was created during Georgia Tech's Coding Boot Camp program in 2019.
